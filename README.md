# Desk-Orders
The Desk Orders project is a project I created in order to demonstrate concepts that I am proficient with. 
The task of this program is to gather information from the user about their orders of desks, and using multiple
factors like wood type, quantity, and amount of drawers to determine a price for the desks. 
This project displays the understanding of various concepts including: Aggregation, Classes and Objects, ArrayLists, 
using loops (for , while, and do while), input validation, use of primitive variables and Strings, reading keyboard input, 
Constructors, Accessor and Mutator methods, Constructors, and toString methods.
